# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hi! I'm a hobbyist programmer from Japan 🇯🇵, passionate about tech and creating cool projects in my free time. I use AI tools to help write English content and explore innovative development techniques.

### 🚀 What I'm Interested In
- **AI-Powered Development**  
  I love using AI to boost my workflow. Recently, I'm amazed by **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code. I also created a custom node for **ComfyUI**:

- **Game Development**  
  I'm currently working on an **indie pixel art game** and experimenting with **Unity Visual Scripting** to bring my ideas to life.

- **Web Development & Chrome Extensions**  
  I built a Chrome extension using the **ChatGPT API** with a React-based web UI:
